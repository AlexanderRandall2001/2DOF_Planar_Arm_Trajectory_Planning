# 2DOF_Planar_Arm_Trajectory_Planning
This project demonstrates joint-space and Cartesian-space trajectory planning for a planar 2-DOF robotic arm in Python. Linear and cubic time scaling are used to generate smooth motion between target positions, with results visualized through animated simulations.
